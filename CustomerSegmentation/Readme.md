# Retail Customer Segmentation

This project involves developing a machine learning model to segment retail customers based on their purchasing behavior. The segmentation helps in tailoring marketing strategies effectively. We use Python with pandas for data manipulation, matplotlib for data visualization, and scikit-learn for implementing the K-Means clustering algorithm. The data is sourced from the UCI Machine Learning Repository's "Online Retail II" dataset.

## Project Overview

- **Objective**: To segment customers of a UK-based online store to understand purchasing behaviors, which can aid in creating targeted marketing strategies.
- **Data Source**: UCI Machine Learning Repository (Online Retail II)
- **Technologies Used**: Python, pandas, matplotlib, scikit-learn

## Getting Started

These instructions will get you a copy of the project up and running on your local machine for development and testing purposes.

### Prerequisites

What you need to install the software:

```
python>=3.7
pandas
matplotlib
scikit-learn
```

### Installation

1. **Clone the repo**
   ```sh
   git clone https://github.com/manikanthdharam/Projects/CustomerSegmentation.git


   ```
2. **Navigate to the project directory and install the necessary packages**
   ```sh
   pip install pandas matplotlib scikit-learn
   ```

### Usage

Execute the main script to run the project:

```sh
python customer_segmentation.py
```

## Data Exploration and Preprocessing

The data includes transaction records for customers. We explore key features, handle missing values, and create new features that help in effective segmentation.

## Model

K-Means clustering algorithm is used to segment the customers based on features like total spending and number of invoices. We experiment with different numbers of clusters to find the optimal segmentation.

## Results

The output is analyzed to understand different customer groups, and the results are visualized to aid in interpreting the segments. Results can further be used to refine marketing strategies and improve business decisions.

## Contributing

Contributions are welcome and appreciated. Whether it's fixing bugs, improving documentation, or suggesting new features, here's how you can contribute:

1. Fork the Project
2. Create your Feature Branch (`git checkout -b feature/AmazingFeature`)
3. Commit your Changes (`git commit -m 'Add some AmazingFeature'`)
4. Push to the Branch (`git push origin feature/AmazingFeature`)
5. Open a Pull Request
