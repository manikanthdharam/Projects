# Stock Market Prediction using LSTM

This project aims to predict future stock prices based on historical data. We utilize Python, pandas for data manipulation, matplotlib for data visualization, and TensorFlow for building a deep learning model. Data is sourced from Yahoo Finance, providing a robust dataset of historical stock prices.

## Project Overview

- **Objective**: To predict the stock price of Apple Inc. using historical data.
- **Data Source**: Yahoo Finance
- **Technologies Used**: Python, pandas, matplotlib, TensorFlow, yfinance

## Getting Started

These instructions will get you a copy of the project up and running on your local machine for development and testing purposes.

### Prerequisites

What things you need to install the software and how to install them:

```
python>=3.7
pandas
matplotlib
tensorflow
yfinance
```

### Installation

1. **Clone the repo**
   ```sh
   git clone https://github.com/your_username_/Project-Name.git
   ```
2. **Install required packages**
   ```sh
   pip install pandas matplotlib tensorflow yfinance
   ```

### Usage

To run the project, execute the main script:

```sh
python stock_predictor.py
```

## Data Exploration and Preprocessing

The data includes various features, but we primarily focus on the 'Close' price to predict future prices. The preprocessing steps include checking for missing values, handling them, and creating new features like moving averages and daily returns.

## Model

We use a Long Short-Term Memory (LSTM) model, which is suitable for sequence prediction problems like time series data. The model is configured with two LSTM layers followed by a dense layer to predict the stock price.

## Results

The model's predictions are visualized against the actual stock prices to evaluate performance. Further tuning and validation can enhance model accuracy.
